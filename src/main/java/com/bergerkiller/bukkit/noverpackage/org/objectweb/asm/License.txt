All classes in the org.objectweb.asm sub-package are of ASM:

ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework.
It can be used to modify existing classes or dynamically generate classes, 
directly in binary form. Provided common transformations and analysis 
algorithms allow to easily assemble custom complex transformations 
and code analysis tools.

ASM offer similar functionality as other bytecode frameworks, but 
it is focused on simplicity of use and performance. Because it was 
designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible, 
it makes it very attractive for using in dynamic systems*.

(*) ASM can of course be used in a static way too.
